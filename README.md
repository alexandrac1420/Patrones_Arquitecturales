## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/alexandrac1420/Aplicaciones_Distribuidas/blob/master/out/diagrama/diagrama.png)

### Overview

The Simple Concurrent Web Server is designed to handle multiple HTTP client requests concurrently using a thread pool. The server is capable of serving static files and processing simple REST-like API requests.

### Components

#### 1. **SimpleWebServer**
   - **Role**: This is the main class of the server. It initializes a `ServerSocket` on a specified port and listens for incoming client connections. The server uses a fixed-size thread pool (`ExecutorService`) to handle each client request concurrently.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Accept incoming client connections.
     - Delegate the handling of each client connection to a `ClientHandler`.
     - Manage the lifecycle of the server, including startup and shutdown.

#### 2. **ClientHandler**
   - **Role**: This class is responsible for processing individual client requests. It implements the `Runnable` interface, allowing it to be executed in a separate thread by the thread pool.
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Read and parse the HTTP request from the client.
     - Serve static files from the specified directory or handle REST-like API requests.
     - Send appropriate HTTP responses back to the client, including handling errors such as "404 Not Found".
     - Close the client socket after processing the request to ensure no resource leaks.

### Interaction Flow

1. **Server Initialization**: The `SimpleWebServer` starts and initializes a `ServerSocket` on port 8080. It also sets up a thread pool with a fixed number of threads.

2. **Request Handling**:
   - When a client sends an HTTP request, the server accepts the connection and creates a new `ClientHandler` instance.
   - The `ClientHandler` reads the request, determines whether it’s a request for a static file or a REST-like API request, and processes it accordingly.
   - The appropriate response (file content, JSON response, or an error message) is sent back to the client.

3. **Concurrency**: Multiple client requests are handled concurrently by the thread pool, allowing the server to efficiently manage several connections at the same time.

4. **Shutdown**: When the server needs to be stopped, it gracefully shuts down the thread pool and closes the server socket.

### Overview

The class diagram for the Simple Concurrent Web Server project provides a detailed view of the components involved in handling HTTP requests and managing server operations. The primary classes include `SimpleWebServer`, `ClientHandler`, `RestService`, and its implementation `HelloService`.

### Class Descriptions

#### 1. **SimpleWebServer**
   - **Role**: The `SimpleWebServer` class acts as the central controller of the server. It listens for incoming HTTP requests on a specific port (typically port 8080) and delegates the handling of these requests to `ClientHandler` instances.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - **ServerSocket Management**: Maintains a `ServerSocket` that listens for client connections.
     - **Concurrency Handling**: Utilizes a `Thread Pool (ExecutorService)` to manage multiple client connections concurrently.
     - **Routing**: Routes incoming requests to the appropriate handler, which could be static file serving or REST API processing.

#### 2. **ClientHandler**
   - **Role**: The `ClientHandler` class is responsible for processing individual HTTP requests. It reads the request, determines the appropriate action (such as serving a static file or processing a REST API request), and returns the response to the client.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - **Request Handling**: Parses HTTP requests and determines the type of response needed.
     - **Static File Serving**: Serves static files like HTML, CSS, and images from the server’s resources.
     - **REST API Processing**: Handles API requests by interacting with various services, such as the `HelloService`.

#### 3. **RestService**
   - **Role**: `RestService` is an abstract class or interface that defines the structure for handling RESTful API requests.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - **Response Generation**: Provides a method to generate responses based on the requests received.

#### 4. **HelloService**
   - **Role**: The `HelloService` class implements the `RestService` interface and is specifically designed to handle requests directed at the `/hello` endpoint.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - **Handling Specific Requests**: Responds to `/hello` requests with a pre-defined message or behavior.

### Relationships Between Classes

- **`SimpleWebServer` and `ClientHandler`**:
  - The `SimpleWebServer` class uses the `ClientHandler` to process each incoming client request. The `ClientHandler` is instantiated and managed by the server, allowing it to handle requests in separate threads provided by the thread pool.
  
- **`SimpleWebServer` and `RestService`**:
  - The `SimpleWebServer` class manages instances of `RestService`, routing requests that match certain patterns (like `/hello`) to the appropriate service. This allows for scalable and modular handling of different API endpoints.

- **`RestService` and `HelloService`**:
  - `HelloService` is a concrete implementation of `RestService`. It defines the specific behavior for the `/hello` endpoint, returning a greeting or other relevant information.

### Summary
This report outlines the unit tests conducted for the Simple Concurrent Web Server project. Each test aimed to validate specific functionalities and behaviors of the server under various conditions. The server was tested for its ability to handle REST-like services, serve static files, handle missing resources, and manage multiple concurrent connections.

### Tests Conducted

1. **Test `testHelloServiceResponse`**
   - **Description**: Validates the server's ability to handle requests to the REST-like hello service.
   - **Objective**: Ensure the server responds correctly with a greeting message when receiving GET requests at `/app/hello`.
   - **Testing Scenario**: Clients simulate HTTP GET requests to `/app/hello?name=World`.
   - **Expected Behavior**: The server should respond with `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` and a JSON message containing the greeting, such as `{"nombre": "World"}` and `Hola, World`.
   - **Verification**: Confirms that the response contains the correct content, validating the server's processing of dynamic requests.

2. **Test `testLoadStaticFile`**
   - **Description**: Checks the server's capability to serve static files.
   - **Objective**: Ensure that the server correctly serves files like `index.html` from the designated directory.
   - **Testing Scenario**: A client requests the `index.html` file from the server.
   - **Expected Behavior**: The server should respond with `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` and the correct content of the `index.html` file.
   - **Verification**: Validates that the file is served correctly, ensuring the server can handle static file requests.

3. **Test `testInvalidRequest`**
   - **Description**: Tests the server's behavior when a requested file does not exist.
   - **Objective**: Ensure the server responds with a `404 Not Found` status for non-existent resources.
   - **Testing Scenario**: A client requests a file that is not present in the server's root directory, such as `nonexistentfile.html`.
   - **Expected Behavior**: The server should respond with `HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found` and an appropriate error message.
   - **Verification**: Confirms that the server handles missing resources correctly, maintaining proper HTTP status codes.

4. **Test `testMultipleConnections`**
   - **Description**: Evaluates the server's ability to handle multiple concurrent connections.
   - **Objective**: Ensure the server can process multiple requests simultaneously without errors or significant performance degradation.
   - **Testing Scenario**: Five clients simultaneously request the `index.html` file from the server.
   - **Expected Behavior**: The server should respond with `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` and the correct content for each request, handling all connections efficiently.
   - **Verification**: Confirms that the server maintains performance and correctness under concurrent load.
